# martin-acm-website
A Website for the UT Martin ACM Chapter

## Description
Right now a single file html page.  If you are an ACM
member feel free to fork this, mess with it, and send over 
pull request for practice.  If one of us deny it we will let 
you know why and help you to redo it.  

## Future Plans
Set everything up better with database support and some dynamic
stuff, maybe some games or something, a list of members, etc.  If 
you have ideas shoot over an email or open an issue.
