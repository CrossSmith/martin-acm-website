# martin-acm-website
A Website for the UT Martin ACM Chapter

## Description
Right now a single file html page.  If you are an ACM
member feel free to fork this, mess with it, and send over 
pull request for practice.  If one of us deny it we will let 
you know why and help you to redo it.  

## Future Plans
Set everything up better with database support and some dynamic
stuff, maybe some games or something, a list of members, etc.  If 
you have ideas shoot over an email or open an issue.

## TODO
 - [ ] Add a contact link that will email all officers
 - [ ] Add some style - use css
 - [ ] Add some style - use bootstrap 4
 - [ ] Add a links page - link to ACM members sites
 - [ ] Add backend and database - I beleive the cs servers alread have
 php and mySQL installed. - Check with Dr. Ericson
 - [ ] Add a proper calendar page
 - [ ] Use jquery or straight javascript to add some cool stuff, maybe hide
 the officers names until a mouse hovers over the Officers heading.
